# Medical Insurance Cost Prediction

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementation for predicting medical insurance costs using machine learning. The project is designed to explore data preprocessing, visualization, and the application of regression models to predict insurance costs based on user demographic and health information.

## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to build a predictive model that estimates medical insurance costs. This can help insurance companies, medical institutions, and users understand the primary factors influencing insurance expenses.

## Features

- **Data Exploration**: Understand the dataset, identify patterns, and explore relationships between features.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, encode categorical data, and normalize numerical features.
- **Visualization**: Generate insightful visualizations to better understand the data.
- **Model Training**: Train regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest) to predict insurance costs.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²).

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information on:
- Age
- Gender
- BMI (Body Mass Index)
- Number of dependents
- Smoker status
- Region
- Medical insurance costs (target variable)

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install these dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/medical-insurance-cost-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd medical-insurance-cost-prediction
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Medical+Insurance+Cost+Prediction.ipynb
   ```
4. Run the notebook cells to execute the analysis and model training.

## Results

The notebook demonstrates:
- Correlation analysis between features and insurance costs.
- Feature importance derived from the trained models.
- Prediction accuracy and model comparison.
